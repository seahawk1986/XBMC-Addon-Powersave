[B]VDR POWERSAVE SERVICE[/B]

[B]Prerequisits:[/B]

- When selecting "Poweroff" in XBMC, your system should well ... power off.

- When planning to use "Suspend" or "Hibernate", your system should also do it,  
  as well as waking up flawless. Otherwise dont use these options. XBMC should
  come up at startup, as well.

- Scheduled wakeups are highly system specific. Therefore I cannot tell you how to 
  setup this feature for your machine. To set the alarm clock, the service will call
  an external script given a "timestamp" parameter. However, assuming your using
  Linux-Kernel 2.6 or newer, and your mainboard supports ACPI wakeup the script 
  would look like this:

#!/bin/sh
echo 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
echo $1 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm

  If thats the case, you might review the file /etc/default/rcS for having the entries:
UTC=yes
HWCLOCKACCESS=no
  
- a VDR backend service, would be usefull to be present for this service. :-)

[B]Configuration:[/B]

- [B]VDR Host & SVDRP-Port:[/B] Those are used to "talk" with your VDR.
- [B]Wakeup before record:[/B] Time to boot up, before the timer. 
- [B]Wakeuptime command (cmd [timestamp]):[/B] Script to call setting the alarm clock.
- [B]Powersave when idle:[/B] Do you want to power down or suspend when idle?
- [B]Powersafe after:[/B] Idle time until powersave.
- [B]Overrun after playback/record:[/B] Extra time when exceeding idle time during record or 
     playback.
- [B]Daily wakeup:[/B] Do you want to wake the system once a day?
- [B]Daily wakeup time (HH:MM):[/B] When do you want to wakeup?

[B]Features:[/B]
- This service handles powersave and wakeup timers independant. Therefore it will wakeup 
  when shutted down by accident or another program than XBMC.

- Timers are checked periodically, sudden changes are to be considered. 

- Idle time is defined as not touching the remote, keyboard or mouse. The service takes care
  of upcomming and active recordings as well as media playback. For example, if you setup
  30 minutes idle timeout and watch a 45 minutes video the system normally should power down
  for being idle after playback stops. But the service will give you the "Overrun" time
  to wake up yourself and grab the remote. ;-)

- Daily wakeup comes at hand when its about to update your EPGs. 

[B]Limitations, known issues:[/B]
- Remote commands issued by web Interface, wont reset the idle counter. This is because
  XBMC dont handles them like common input. 

- The service is unable to detect VDR activities to other clients. Say, you stream TV
  towards your local PC, it would not notice it. 

- Due to a Bug in XBMC, profiles are not handled very well when it comes to services. 
  Logging out may result in killing the services, not coming up when logging back again.
